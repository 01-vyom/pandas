pandas (0.7.0~rc1+git75-gb0ee06b-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Testing fresh upstream snapshot prior release
  * Updated pre-cythoned .c files for older Debian/Ubuntu releases
  * Dropped all exclusions of unittests and patches -- shouldn't be necessary
    any longer
  * Build only for requested versions (not all supported) of Python
  * Do nothing for build operation, rely on overloaded install
    (to avoid undesired re-cythonization on elderly Ubuntus)
